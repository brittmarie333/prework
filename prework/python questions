Question 1
Write a function to print “hello_USERNAME!” USERNAME is the input of the function. The first line of the code has been defined as below.


    def hello_name(user_name): print("hello," + user_name + "!")


     
Question 2
Write a python function, first_odds that prints the odd numbers from 1-100 and returns nothing


    def first_odds():
        .....
Question 3
Please write a Python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. The first line of the code has been defined as below.


    def max_num_in_list(a_list):
        "max umber in list"
        max= 0
        for num in data:
            if num > max
            maxium = num 
            return maximum
        print(max_num_inlist([0, 4, 16]))
        .....
Question 4
Write a function to return if the given year is a leap year. A leap year is divisible by 4, but not divisible by 100, unless it is also divisible by 400. The return should be boolean Type (true/false).


   true 
   
   def leap_year(y): 
    id yield % 400 == 0:
    return True
if yield % 100 == 0:
        return False
if yield % 4 == 0:
        return True
else:
        return False
print(leap_year(1900))
print(leap_year(2004))
        .....
Question 5
Write a function to check to see if all numbers in list are consecutive numbers. For example, [2,3,4,5,6,7] are consecutive numbers, but [1,2,4,5] are not consecutive numbers. The return should be boolean Type.


    def _is_consecutive(a_list):
        """Checks to see if the numbers in a list are consecutive"""
        total =2
        while total > 1:
             test = a_list.pop(0)
             if test == a_list[0] - 1:
                  total = len(a_list)
                  return True
             else:
                  return False
             break
        works = is_consecutive(check)
        print(works)
